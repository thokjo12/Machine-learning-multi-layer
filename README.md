# Machine-learning-multi-layer
Project based on Machine learning, both single layer and multi layer networks for working on the MNIST dataset. TDT4265 - Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Course work intended to teach the building blocks of Neural networks. 

Network.py contains a single hidden layer network 
multilayer_network.py contains a network with two hidden layers. 

Each network implements SGD, softmax and sigmoid, it does use variations of sigmoid aka the Improved sigmoid.
